* sklearn
* numpy

* Run the `kmeans*.ipyb` notebook by doing KMeans on train data. 
* `d1.out`, `d2.out`, `d3.out` files are generated for a model in `hmm-1.04` directory
* Run `run.sh` for building and training each `d1` on d1,d2,d3 hmm models
* Accuracy of test class is in `hmm-1.04\hmm_alphas\acc.log`
